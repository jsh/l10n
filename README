A simple example of i18n and l10n, with the classic hello, world

hello.c  - the canonical program.
Makefile - the usual.
po       - the l10n files, including a Spanish subdirectory and a script to install and config Ubuntu's Spanish package.
README   - this file. Duh.
setup    - configure ubuntu for i18n
t        - a simple test.
